Data Analytics
---------------------

Goal to analyze CHOP Biorepository data with R and Python where needed create a web based dashboard on biorepository specimen data in D3.js.


## D3.js
> Need to get my head wrapped around the ins and outs of D3.js
> There are a lot of templates out there, but doesn't help me learn it.
> Doing some tutorial work which will be in this repository.
> Need to also get down to basics and not start from a template.
> Not too familiar with SVG and not a web developer, so if I want to do this right, I have to start from scratch!
